# Flight Savings Calculator

## Overview
The Flight Savings Calculator is an intuitive tool designed to calculate the fuel and CO2 emission savings from reduced potable water weight on an Airbus A350 flight. This project extrapolates the benefits of reducing potable water onboard, inspired by an initiative highlighted in an Aerotime article about IndiGo's strategy.

## Features
- Calculates fuel savings in metric tons and nautical miles.
- Estimates CO2 emissions reduction.
- Determines cost savings in USD.
- Evaluates EU ETS and CORSIA penalty savings.

## How to Use
1. Open the `flight-savings-calculator.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter the flight distance in kilometers or nautical miles.
3. Adjust the water weight reduction percentage as needed.
4. Click on the "Calculate Savings" button to view the results.

## Assumptions
The calculations are based on several assumptions:
- Water Weight Reduction: 98% reduction from 300 kg.
- Fuel Efficiency: 5 liters per km (or 2.7 liters per NM) for the A350.
- Flight Distance: 14,535 km (or 7,847 NM) from Auckland to Doha.
- Fuel Density: 0.8 kg/liter.
- CO2 Emissions: 3.15 kg of CO2 per kg of fuel.
- Fuel Cost: USD 2 per liter.
- EU ETS Cost: USD 50 per ton of CO2.
- CORSIA Cost: USD 20 per ton of CO2.

## Technology
This calculator was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculations and logic were assisted by an advanced language model, ChatGPT.

## Disclaimer
The values and calculations provided by the Flight Savings Calculator are estimations based on the aforementioned assumptions. Actual savings may vary.
